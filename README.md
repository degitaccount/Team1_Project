# Data Analytics Bootcamp - Team 1 Final Poject

## Project Overview

Initially launched in 2012, the World Happiness Report reflects the results from an annual survey published by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN).  Since its inception, the most important data for the World Happiness Report has been the responses to the main life evaluation questions in the Gallup World Poll from respondents in more than 150 countries.  Therefore, for purposes of the report, happiness is measured based on six factors (GDP, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption).  This approach helps to standardize how happiness is measured and compared across multiple geographies.


## Machine Learnings Aspects

**INSERT MACHINE LEARNING DESCRIPTION**

***RUBRIC: Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:***
* Takes in data in from the provisional database
* Outputs label(s) for input data


## Database Integration

**INSERT DATABASE DESCRIPTION**

***RUBRIC: Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:***

* Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
* Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database






1.       What is our topic?

The topic we chose is world happiness.

2.       Why did we choose the topic?

We chose the topic because we would like to understand differences in happiness between multiple regions and over different years.


3.       What is question(s) are we trying to answer?

We want to answer the following questions:
- What are the happiest countries?
- What will the happiness scores be for these countries in the following year?
- How have happiness scores trended over multiple years?
- What factors impacted the happiness scores for countries the most?

4.       What is the data source we plan to use?
