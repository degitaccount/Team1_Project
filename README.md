# Data Analytics Bootcamp - Team 1 Final Poject

## Project Overview

Initially launched in 2012, the World Happiness Report reflects the results from an annual survey published by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN).  Since its inception, the most important data for the World Happiness Report has been the responses to the main life evaluation questions in the Gallup World Poll from respondents in more than 150 countries.  Therefore, for purposes of the report, happiness is measured based on six factors (GDP, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption).  This approach helps to standardize how happiness is measured and compared across multiple geographies.
